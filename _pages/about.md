I am a Postdoc Associate of the [Quantum Measurement Group](qm.mit.edu) at MIT. I got my PhD at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Bi-Cheng Zhou](https://engineering.virginia.edu/zhou-group) where I created a cluster-based thermodynamics framework that benefits computational thermodynamics. I am actively looking for my future academic position after my current Postdoc appointment to continue further exploring diverse applied sciences such as materials science/mechanical engineering/nuclear science/applied physics/chemical engineering with my applied mathematics style.  
My current Servant Class is **Framer X Saber (Mathematics->Excalibur)** based on the calling: to bravely build up the theoretical/computational **frame**work for applied science with the power of mathematics. 

Research Statements
---
I am interested in various topics within **Theoretical/Computational Materials Science** under the philosophy of **Applied Mathematics**. My research interests varied from pure mathematics to applied mathematics and applied science when I was a junior student in my undergraduate school. Though I was impressed by partial differential equations, geometry, and topology during my undergraduate years, some physics-related research experience(quantization of dislocations) and the great Chia-Chiao Lin's landmark pioneer contributions in applied mathematics attracted me. In recent years, I have been activated by Prof. Weinan E's vision to explore the [new era in applied mathematics](https://www.ams.org/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf) with coherently integrating first-principle modelings, data-driven methods, algorithms & fundamental mathematics & domain knowledge: physics led materials science. 

My interests could be summarized as the spanned space of {"Imperfection", "Representations", "Transport", and "Stability"}, which I would like to explain more in future statements. Some of my current projects involve heat transport, neutron/x-ray scattering, quantum dots, mesoscale defects, nucleation theory, and thermodynamic stability.
