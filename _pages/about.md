I’m retired in the US. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Quantum Measurement Group](http://qm.mit.edu) at MIT, a truly exceptional team that integrates theory, computation, and experiment in condensed matter physics and materials science. There, I gained valuable experience in bridging theoretical insights with experimental characterization. I earned my PhD in materials science from the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), where I created a cluster-based thermodynamic framework that advanced computational thermodynamics. I remain actively engaged in pursuing my academic vision, continuing to explore diverse areas of applied science, including materials science, mechanical engineering, nuclear science, applied physics, and chemical engineering, through the lens of my applied mathematics perspective.
My current Servant Class is **Framer X Saber (Mathematics->Excalibur)** based on the calling: to build up the theoretical/computational **frame**work for applied science with the power of mathematics. [\[A piece of slides of my JOB TALK is shared here\]](http://ChuLiangFu.github.io/files/RS_Chuliang.pdf), which is titled as *The Delicacy of “Imperfection”: Thermodynamics, Transport, and Spectroscopy as Lenses*. A comment article on materials science education is shared here: [\[What’s the difference between Materials Science and Condensed Matter Physics?\]](http://ChuLiangFu.github.io/files/RS_Chuliang.pdf), the corresponding Chinese version is released on wechat [

Research Statements
---
I am interested in various topics within **Theoretical/Computational Materials Science** under the philosophy of **Applied Mathematics**. My research interests varied from pure mathematics to applied mathematics and applied science when I was a junior student in my undergraduate school. Though I was impressed by partial differential equations, geometry, and topology during my undergraduate years, some physics-related research experience(quantization of dislocations) and the great Chia-Chiao Lin's landmark pioneer contributions in applied mathematics attracted me. In recent years, I have been activated by Prof. Weinan E's vision to explore the [new era in applied mathematics](https://www.ams.org/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf) with coherently integrating first-principle modelings, data-driven methods, algorithms & fundamental mathematics & domain knowledge: physics-led materials science. 

My interests could be summarized as the spanned space of {"Imperfection", "Representations", "Transport", and "Stability"}, which I would like to explain more in future statements. Some of my current projects involve heat transport, neutron/x-ray scattering, data-driven spectroscopy, quantum dots, mesoscale defects, and thermodynamic stability.
